# Research-of-Apartment-Sale-Listings

Project Description  

We have access to data from the Yandex Real Estate service — an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring towns for several years.  
We need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Our task is to conduct a research analysis of the data, which will help to establish the parameters that affect the price of objects. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.  

Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first are entered by the user, the second are obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport and other objects — this data is automatically obtained from geoservices. The number of parks and reservoirs is also filled in without user participation.
